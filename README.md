# Chainlink and Etherisc Joint Grants
Welcome to the Chainlink and Etherisc Grant Platform! 

The Chainlink and Etherisc Grant Platform connects grant makers with builders and researchers 
in the Chainlink and Etherisc communities. Whether you represent a foundation that wants to move 
the space forward, a company looking to accelerate development on the features your application needs, 
or a dev team itching to hack on Chainlink and Etherisc tools, you've come to the right place. 
Take a look at the supported grant types and available opportunities below.

## Grant Types

__Prototype:__

Grants are available to support taking the next step after you have created an initial 
prototype with Chainlink and Etherisc. These grants are intended for independent developers, 
small studios, non-profits, activists, and researchers. Applicants may be working independently, 
or as part of a course or hackathon. Relevant proposals should be labeled ```category:prototype```

__Core development:__

With this track, we will fund collaborators with proposals tackling core protocol research, 
specification, and implementation work. Relevant proposals should be labeled category:core-dev.
Application development: Weâ€™re seeking talented application developers to build useful and delightful 
applications that utilize Chainlink and Etherisc as the decentralized storage layer. 
Relevant proposals should be labeled ```category:app-dev```.

__Developer tools and libraries:__

We are always looking for proposals for the development of developer tools and libraries for 
both core protocol developers and application developers. Dev tools at all layers of the 
stack are invaluable! Relevant proposals should be labeled ```category:devtools-libraries```.

__Integration and adoption__:

We are interested in supporting the growth of Chainlink and 
Etherisc and related technologies via integration into existing app or projects with significant usage. 
Technical assistance is also available. Relevant proposals should be labeled ```category:integration-adoption```

__Technical design:__ 

We want ideas that will improve on the Chainlink and Etherisc protocol technical design, 
for example improvement proposals on the core storage protocol, cryptoeconomics design, 
or on other planned network upgrades. Relevant proposals should be labeled ```category:technical-design```.

__Documentation and Education:__

We understand how crucial documentation and education is 
for open-source projects and welcome proposals to create or improve existing materials. 
Relevant proposals should be labeled ```category:docs```.

__Research:__

We are keen on receiving proposals that explore the processes and incentives of decentralized insurance. 
Relevant proposals should be labeled ```category:research```.

## Criteria
Projects must meet these 5 criteria:
1. You've already built something with Chainlink and Etherisc 
   (or closely related technologies), independently or as part of a course or hackathon.
2. You can provide a clear and straightforward description of the next step 
   you plan to take with grant support.
3. You can complete this work within 3 - 6 months.
4. You agree to open-source this work, via [Apache 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) license for code or 
   [CC-BY-SA 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/) license for content.
5. You agree to complete weekly updates and a grant report upon conclusion, 
   with the results of your grant funded work as well as a description of your experience building with 
   Chainlink and Etherisc technologies, including any challenges or shortcomings encountered.

## FAQ
1. How do I apply?
   
   To submit a Grant proposal, [create a new issue](https://github.com/etherisc/chainlink-and-etherisc-grants/issues/new?assignees=christoph2806&labels=&template=grant-application.md&title=Chainlink%2FEtherisc+Grant+Application%3A+%3CYour+Title+Here%3E) 
   using the Grants Proposal template.

2. What happens after I apply? 

   Grant proposals are reviewed bi-weekly. During review, we will add comments, questions, 
   change requests, et cetera on your team's submission.

   After a few round trips of discussion, our team will make a decision on which proposals 
   to fund and which not to.

   If your team is accepted, we will ask you to sign our Open Source Software Grant Agreement, 
   which will include a copy of the work plan and funding milestones.

   We aim to complete all review within a month of application.

3. What if I have additional questions?
