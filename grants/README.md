# Grant Applications

## About
Do you have an idea for pushing the Chainlink and Etherisc ecosystem forward? Open grants are intended to support novel ideas that advance the Chainlink and Etherisc ecosystem, bring significant new usage, or directly advance the Chainlink and Etherisc mission statement. Proposals should include deliverables, milestones, and funding requests. Deviations from the specified scope of the project must be approved between the team and the Foundation grants team. 

Here are the priority focus areas, but we welcome proposals from all categories.

-## Grant Types

__Prototype:__

Grants are available to support taking the next step after you have created an initial
prototype with Chainlink and Etherisc. These grants are intended for independent developers,
small studios, non-profits, activists, and researchers. Applicants may be working independently,
or as part of a course or hackathon. Relevant proposals should be labeled ```category:prototype```

__Core development:__

With this track, we will fund collaborators with proposals tackling core protocol research,
specification, and implementation work. Relevant proposals should be labeled category:core-dev.
Application development: We‚Äôre seeking talented application developers to build useful and delightful
applications that utilize Chainlink and Etherisc as the decentralized storage layer.
Relevant proposals should be labeled ```category:app-dev```.

__Developer tools and libraries:__

We are always looking for proposals for the development of developer tools and libraries for
both core protocol developers and application developers. Dev tools at all layers of the
stack are invaluable! Relevant proposals should be labeled ```category:devtools-libraries```.

__Integration and adoption__:

We are interested in supporting the growth of Chainlink and
Etherisc and related technologies via integration into existing app or projects with significant usage.
Technical assistance is also available. Relevant proposals should be labeled ```category:integration-adoption```

__Technical design:__

We want ideas that will improve on the Chainlink and Etherisc protocol technical design,
for example improvement proposals on the core storage protocol, cryptoeconomics design,
or on other planned network upgrades. Relevant proposals should be labeled ```category:technical-design```.

__Documentation and Education:__

We understand how crucial documentation and education is
for open-source projects and welcome proposals to create or improve existing materials.
Relevant proposals should be labeled ```category:docs```.

## ‚åõ After you apply

After you submit your proposal, you can expect the following to occur:

- We will review your application. During review, we will add comments, questions, change requests, 
et cetera on your team's submission.
- After a few round trips of discussion, our team will make a decision on which proposals to fund and which not to. <!--
Accepted proposals will be merged into the appropriate directory, i.e. either 
[`large-grant`](https://github.com/etherisc/chainlink-and-etherisc-grants/tree/master/large-grant) or 
[`rfp-proposals`](https://github.com/etherisc/chainlink-and-etherisc-grants/tree/master/rfp-proposals).-->
- During the discussion and review phase, we will contact your team for financial and legal follow-ups, 
such as to confirm milestones and funding, your team's legal structure, etc.
- If your team is accepted, we will ask you to sign our Open Source Software Grant Agreement, which will include a 
copy of the work plan and funding milestones. 
- We aim to complete all review within a few weeks after the wave deadline, so please stay vigilant on GitHub.
